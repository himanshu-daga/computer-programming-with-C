# Computer programming with C

## Uses of this repo
It is a step by step guide for beginners in programming. It is divided into weeks and in each week there is a set of questions that the individual should be able to solve by that week if s/he is consistent in learning.

It can also be used as a guide to revise the C language and basic programming concepts.

## Contribution guidelines
It is a basic programmers guide in C currently but I wish to expand it to other languages soon so if you wish to create something similar in other languages like Python, Jave, Kotlin, Go, etc. feel free to contribute. Just keep them in a folder with name of that language and inside that week 1,2,3 and so on like: 'Python/week-1/ques-1.py'
